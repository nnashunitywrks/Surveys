<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>The purpose of this study is to help us improve on the design of our website. This task requires that you install a plug-in to proceed. The plugin will allow you to share your screen and microphone for the duration of the test.
For this task, it is important to “think out loud.” For example, pretend we are having a conversation: If I asked you, “how many windows are in your home?”, how would you respond?
Instructions</p>

<p>Please note that for this test, you’ll be using a prototype, not a finished product. Some features may be missing or unresponsive. If something doesn’t work as expected, tell us what you think should happen.</p>
