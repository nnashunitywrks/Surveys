<strong>Description</strong>

<p>
  This HIT is an unmoderated remote usability session, and its purpose is to help us improve the design of our website. You will be testing an interactive prototype, keep in mind that this prototype does not represent the final product. It is helpful to think of a prototype as a series of sketches linked together by computer software. For this task, it is important to think out loud by describing what you are doing and seeing.
</p>

<strong>Instructions</strong>
<p>Open the link to the prototype, install the plugin and complete the following tasks. Remember to think out loud. If you notice something that isn’t working properly say what is wrong and what you think should happen.</p>

<ol>
  <li>What is your first impression of the site?</li>
  <li>Where would you click to buy a product?</li>
  <li>Where would you click to change how many of an item you’re buying?</li>
  <li>Complete the checkout process using information from www.fakenamegenerator.com ** Do Not Use Real Information! **</li>
</ol>

<p>
  <strong>Note to workers:</strong> Once you have completed the task ensure that you upload the session. This HIT requires you to install a plugin and share your screen, microphone, and webcam. Work that doesn’t meet this requirement may be disqualified.
